Here’s a complete example for your **`README.md`** file tailored to your project. I'll use the name **"Medicine Management System"** for the project, but feel free to change it if you'd like.

# **Medicine Management System**

### **Project Overview**
The **Medicine Management System** is a console-based application written in C++ that allows users to manage a pharmacy's inventory. It includes features for both suppliers and buyers:
- Suppliers can add and update medicine stock.
- Buyers can browse available medicines, make purchases, and view updated stock.
- Includes user registration and login for security.

This project demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and dynamic memory allocation.

### **Features**
1. **Supplier Functionalities:**
   - Add new medicines to the inventory.
   - Update stock and price for existing medicines.
   - Display the list of available medicines with details.

2. **Buyer Functionalities:**
   - View available medicines.
   - Purchase medicines based on quantity.
   - Receive discounts for bulk purchases (if more than 4 items are bought).
   - View a detailed bill of purchased medicines.

3. **User Authentication:**
   - Secure user registration with name and password.
   - Login functionality for registered users.

4. **Updated Stock Management:**
   - Track and display stock changes after purchases.

### **How to Run the Project**
1. **Requirements:**
   - A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or Visual Studio).
   - A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or Dev-C++).

2. **Steps to Compile and Run:**
   - Clone this repository or download the source files:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medicine-management-system.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd medicine-management-system
     ```
   - Compile the code:
     ```bash
     g++ -o medicine_management src/medicine_management.cpp
     ```
   - Run the program:
     ```bash
     ./medicine_management
     ```

### **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **OOP Concepts:** Inheritance, encapsulation, dynamic memory allocation.
- **File Handling:** Used for saving user data (registration details).
- **Standard Libraries:** `<iostream>`, `<fstream>`, `<iomanip>`, `<string>`.

### **Example Usage**
1. **Supplier Workflow:**
   - Register/login to the system.
   - Input details of medicines (name, price, stock).
   - Update the stock or add more medicines later.

   Example:
   ```
   Enter the number of medicines you are supplying: 2
   Enter name for medicine 1: Paracetamol
   Enter price for Paracetamol: 50
   Enter stock for Paracetamol: 100
   Enter name for medicine 2: Aspirin
   Enter price for Aspirin: 30
   Enter stock for Aspirin: 200
   ```

2. **Buyer Workflow:**
   - View available medicines.
   - Choose medicines by serial number and specify quantity.
   - View the total bill and updated stock.

   Example:
   ```
   Enter the number of medicines you want to buy: 2
   Enter serial number of medicine: 1
   Enter quantity for Paracetamol: 5
   Enter serial number of medicine: 2
   Enter quantity for Aspirin: 10
   ```

   Output:
   ```
   Total Bill: 310
   Updated Stock:
   Paracetamol: 95
   Aspirin: 190
   ```

### **Future Enhancements**
- Add a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
- Include database integration for larger-scale inventory management.
- Add more roles, such as administrators, for advanced control.
